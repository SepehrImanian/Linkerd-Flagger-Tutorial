# linkerd-docs

##### This is the summary and the concepts that I learned from linkerd, I try to update this repo always and add anything new that I learn here, I would be very happy to contribute to this repo, and if you like it, you can contact me via my email and add new things we learned about linkerd here.

##### This document that I wrote consists of several separate parts :

* ### [Architecture Of Linkerd](./linkerd-architecture.md)

> This part explained the general concepts of linked and main components

* ### [Linkerd Concepts](./linkerd.md)

> Here I have explained the concepts that are exactly one of the characteristics of linkerd. In this part, I tried to explain only the sentences and keywords that you need to know in order to understand each of the linkerd concepts in the smallest possible volume.

* ### [Linkerd](./use-linkerd.md)

> This is exactly the part where you enter the linked world and learn all the scenarios you need in a practical way.

* ### [Linkerd MTLS](./linkerd-mtls.md)

> And in this part, you will learn all the skills you need to know about TLS and its difference with MTLs and how to manage it, including renewing certificates manually and automatically, and their different types of linkerd certificates.
